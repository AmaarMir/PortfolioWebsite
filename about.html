                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My journey began at a young age, designing logos and graphics, which sparked my interest in creating impactful, user-centered designs. Over the years, I've honed my skills in graphic design, wireframing, and combining technical knowledge with creativity. I specialize in crafting solutions that not only look beautiful but also improve user interaction.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Information Science at the University of Maryland, where I focused on integrating design principles with technology. Prior to that, I transferred from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where I initially pursued a Bachelor's in Business Technology Administration. This transition marked a pivotal moment in my career as I realized my passion for design, which ultimately led me to the iSchool at UMD to further explore the field.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s of Science in Human-Computer Interaction at the University of Maryland, where I continue to explore the intersection of design and technology. With a strong foundation in data analysis, storytelling, and visual communication, I focus on creating designs that are functional, inclusive, and visually engaging.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve had the privilege of working on various projects, from interning as a graphic design assistant to leading creative teams in dynamic web application projects. I've also been recognized for my work, including placing second in the Howard County “Choose Civility” poster design contest. I’m eager to continue creating designs that inspire, educate, and engage.</p>
