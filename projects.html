            <h2>Public School Bullying Analysis for the Maryland Commission of LGBTQIA+ Affairs</h2>
            <p>For this project, I worked with a team to analyze public school bullying data, with a specific focus on sexual harassment cases, to assist the Maryland Commission of LGBTQIA+ Affairs. My role involved researching and gathering relevant data and sources, ensuring the information was comprehensive and up-to-date. Using this data, we created clear and impactful data visualizations that highlighted trends over the course of a decade, showcasing patterns in bullying incidents related to sexual harassment. I contributed to the design of these visualizations and collaborated on interpreting the data to provide actionable insights and policy recommendations aimed at improving safety and inclusivity in schools. This project allowed me to combine my skills in data analysis, information design, and storytelling to create solutions that can inform meaningful change and support the work of the commission.</p>

            <h2>NFL Salary Cap Expenditure and it's affect on NFL organizations</h2>
            <p>For this project, I created a data story using Tableau to analyze the salary cap distribution of the Denver Broncos between 2018 and 2026. My goal was to explore how the team allocated resources between offense and defense, and how these financial decisions influenced their performance in the NFL seasons. I developed dynamic visualizations that not only highlighted key insights specific to the Broncos but were also designed to be applicable to all NFL teams, enabling broader comparisons. In addition to building the data story, I performed data cleaning to ensure that the data was correctly labeled, and only relevant information was included. This project allowed me to leverage my skills in data visualization and analysis to provide valuable insights into how financial strategies can impact team success in professional sports.</p>

            <h2>Password Manager</h2>
            <p>In this project, I collaborated with a team of professionals to create a password manager website designed to help users secure their important information. The website allows individuals to input a password and receive feedback on its strength, as well as a check to see if the password has been compromised in any known data breaches. Our goal was to provide an easy-to-use tool that helps people generate strong, secure passwords and manage their online safety. I contributed to the design and functionality of the website, ensuring a seamless user experience while delivering critical security insights.</p>
